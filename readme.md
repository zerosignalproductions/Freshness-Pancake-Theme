# Freshness - A Pancake Theme #

**Freshness** is a brand new theme brought to you by Zero Signal Productions for Pancake, an excellent billing and invoice application. We wanted the theme to work with the playfulness of the Pancake brand so we use the same bright colors and button styles as the original theme but with an added kick.

## How to Install ##

Download the zip file and simply unzip into your **third_party** directory. 

Activate **zerosignal** in **Settings > General > Admin Theme**

How do add your phone/fax to the invoice:

`.fax         { display: block; }
.fax:after   { content: "fax number"; }

.phone       { display: block; }
.phone:after { content: "phone number"; }`

* Added Gravatar support to comment pages
